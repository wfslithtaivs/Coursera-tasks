Resulted tidy data set provides average time and frequency measures (features variables) 
for every activity for every subject. 

For "means" it makes sense, but with "standard deviation" I have a logical trouble ) 

(Proof of tidying resTidyData.txt is here - http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper - table.3 shows exactly what we have in the result table:

1. Each variable in a column.
2. Each observation in a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table. )
